	Sinhagad is an ancient hill fortress located at around 49 km southwest of the city of Pune, India. Previously known as Kondhana, the fort had been the site of many battles, most notably the Battle of Sinhagad in 1670. It is located in the Pune district in Maharashtra<p>Visit to the fort is mandatory, if you are in Pune... Full of history. Get a guide as well, other wise you will be missing a lot many things.
You can reach the hill top by car at the base of the citadel. How ever there is a mad rush on weekends and on 31st December / long weekends.
Once the parking is full, traffic is stopped at the bottom of the hill. There can be a severe traffic jam at the top.
So... Avoid holidays.
Alternatively there is a walking track of five kilometers for those who are physically fit.
However if you must see the place,on holidays, reach the fort before 6:00am in the morning ...which is the best time and see the sunrise. Avoid afternoon, especially in the Summer as it can get very hot.
Some points.. Apart from the crowds, the place is littered with plastic waste.
In any way.. this is a must see place.</p>
